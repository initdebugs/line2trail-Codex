Project Idea: Line2Trail (working name)

A draw-your-own-route planner for hiking, running, cycling, and walking.

Core Concept

Line2Trail lets users trace a line on the map with their finger, and the app automatically snaps it to real-world paths, trails, and roads. It then gives them a clean route with distance, elevation, and turn cues — something between a casual sketch and a professional navigation tool.

The app is lightweight, offline-friendly, and designed for hikers, runners, cyclists, and casual travelers who want quick custom routes without wrestling with traditional route planners.

Key Features
1. Draw-to-Route

Users draw directly on the map with their finger.

The app snaps the sketch to existing paths/roads.

Distance, estimated time, and path type (road, trail, cycleway) instantly shown.

2. Editing Tools

Undo/redo strokes.

Add/move waypoints to adjust snapped routes.

Split and merge routes easily.

3. Profiles / Activity Modes

Walking, running, hiking, cycling — each with different routing preferences.

Adjusts distance/time estimates accordingly.

4. Route Details

Elevation profile: gain/loss, slope visualization.

Turn-by-turn cue sheet: step list for navigation.

Surface hints: paved vs. unpaved where data allows.

5. Navigation Mode

Voice prompts for turn-by-turn directions.

Big, simplified map for hiking/cycling use.

Auto re-center if the user goes off route.

6. Save & Organize

Save routes locally in collections/folders.

Tag routes (e.g., “weekend hikes,” “training runs”).

Search/filter by distance, elevation, activity.

7. Export & Import

Export routes as GPX/TCX/GeoJSON for use in GPS watches or other apps.

Import GPX files to redraw/edit.

8. Offline Support

Cache maps for selected areas.

Use app in airplane mode (routes planned before trip remain available).

Optional downloadable offline regions (maps + elevation data).

9. Explore Nearby (Optional Add-on)

Show popular trails/paths in the area.

Suggest loops of a target distance (e.g., “Find me a 10 km loop near here”).

Why This App Is Valuable

For hikers & runners: Easy way to sketch a loop or one-way route without fiddling with tons of waypoints.

For cyclists: Quick route planning before a ride, with elevation info.

For casual users: Plan a scenic walk in an unfamiliar city by just tracing the rough shape you want.

For all: Works offline, with exports for GPS watches or cycling computers.
