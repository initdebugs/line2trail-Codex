1. Just remove the English langauge option. We will keep everything in Dutch for now. so please also remove the option from the settings

2. The loop button says: Route is already a loop. Which is not true. The last waypoint I added is well over 500m from the begin waypoint. Please check and fix

3. The km marker is not visible on the map as a marker. Not sure why but please fix.

4. Please add a map layer option from maptiler. It will be one I found. I found a few links and not sure which one you should use so you pick please:
