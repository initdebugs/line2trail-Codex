1. Please remove the English langauge option. We will keep everything in Dutch for now. so please also remove the option from the settings

2. The km marker is not visible on the map as a marker. It should show a marker just like the waypoint marker but then a different color on the route where each km (or mile depending on unit setting) is placed so the user see it. I tried implementing it but it is not working. Please fix that.
