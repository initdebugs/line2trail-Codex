1. For regular route drawing; I'd like you to make the different modes of drawing the same. They should all be able to go on any type of road/path. Currently the walking mode avoids roads. I don't want any avoiding anymore. Make them all the same by allowing them to go anywhere. The only difference is the speed/time it takes. 

2. Fully redesign the roundtrip dialog UI design. I don't want to scroll there, everything should be visible at a glance. Make it a nice UI and UX.

3. Remove the option for map layers and just always use the basic openstreetmap map. Remove the Stadia map. Remove the map layers button from the screen.

4. There is an overflow error in the routes screen with the 'distance - time - when route was made' is too big. See @errors.md

5. Make the movement of the map when clicking a search result smooth by panning and zooming smoothly (animated). Also when the user presses the location button.
