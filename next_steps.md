1. Routes are not instantly visible to see in the routes screen. make it so that when you save a route, the routes screen auto refreshes.
2. Pressing a route from the routes screen just opens a black screen and does nothing else.
3. The button for roundtrip does not look nice. Please reposition everything in that section to make it look nice
4. In the routes screen it says 'Unknown location' instead of the city in which this takes place.
5. In the routes screen, make it so instead of a dropdown, the navigate and delete button are visible without having to open the dropdown. Navigate a blue navigation button with white arrow.
