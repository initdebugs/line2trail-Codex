1. Make the following settings actually functional and remembered when the app closes and reopens:
- Language


2. The animations in the routebar only work when the user is already drawing, then pressing stop or draw. Looks good. When the user is not yet drawing, pressing 'Draw' moves it instantly instead of the smooth animations. Please fix that so the animations always work in the routebar.

3. Currently when I press the location button to go to the users current location, it has to fetch location first which takes a few seconds. Maybe update the users location every 5 seconds and use the last known location when pressing that button? Would improve the UX
