1. In the route detail screen there's a small map that shows the route on the map. Please make it also show the begin and end point of that route on that map.

2. The animation for the routebar is not yet present. The switching between the draw mode and stop drawing mode is still instant. ALso the animation for the search bar and time/distance widget is not fully ready. Currently:
- Enter draw mode: search bar instantly disapears and the time/distance widget instantly appears.
- Stop draw mode: time/distance widget instantly disapears and search bar appears animated.

Please fix
