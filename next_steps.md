1. Make it possible to save a route. Pressing the save button should open a popup where the user can give it a name. This route should then be shown in the routes screen in a very nice way (not the map) with information like distance, name, time, approx location (city), date/time route was created, etc. Make it look nice. Make sure it is saved even when the app is closed. Also add a placeholder button for 'Navigate', which we will implement later. Also make a delete butotn (trash can icon) with confirmation for deletion. Once a route is saved from the map screen, it should be instantly visible in the routes screen. When a route is clicked on from the routes screen, it should be imported in the maps screen visible to see.
2. Please look at the index.html file in this folder. It is a web version I drafted before creating this app. It has a roundtrip feature. Please create a button (placeholder) for such a feature in the routebar. Make it fit nicely next to the other buttons, only visible when route drawing has not yet begun. When route drawing is activated, hide the button just like the mode button
